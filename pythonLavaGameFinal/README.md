# How to use seeds

### (If you don't know about seeds don't read this, it's useless)
I learnt about seeds during my project so I decided to add them, but not to the game cuz my teachers would be too stupid to understand what it is and im too lazy to explain to them anyways.

So somewhere in the main.py file (the one in menuuu, the other ones are garbage you can *probably* delete them), you got these 5 lines (look for `def game()` *i think* it's written only once). 
```py
def game():
    # global random
    # global numpy
    # random.seed(2)
    # numpy.random.seed(2)
```
Un-comment the lines (or the move the **hashtags** idk what we say exactly).
The seed is **2**.
